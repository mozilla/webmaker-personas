          <h1>UX Personas</h1>
          <p class="heavy">To better understand Webmaker’s audience, we conducted interviews, research and analysis of real users’ motivations and struggles. This work led to eight archetypal, fictional characters that highlight distinct needs and expectations. Real-life users are complex and always changing, but these personas will more easily let us enter the headspace of users who are different from us. And as we contemplate pathways through Webmaker that meet various needs, we can refer to our users by name.</p>
